## Multi-agent Path Planning using Pacti

This case study uses Pacti to find the strategy for multiple robots avoiding collisions while navigating on a grid.

Pacti's documentation can be found on the website at [www.pacti.org](https://www.pacti.org). For discussions on the use of Pacti or this case study, please visit the [Pacti Discussion Forum](https://github.com/orgs/pacti-org/discussions).
The source code for developers can be found [here](https://github.com/pacti-org/pacti).

This is the [Robotarium](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu) implementation of a strategy for five robots found using Pacti:
